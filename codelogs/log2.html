	<h2>What is the difference between absolute and relative CSS length units?</h2>
		<body>
			<p>In CSS, there are two main ways to measure size which are called absolute units and relative units. Absolute units are fixed, meaning they stay the same size no matter what. For example, if you make a box 100px wide, it will always try to stay 100px wide whether you are on a phone, laptop, or TV. Units like px for pixels, cm for centimeters, or in for inches are all absolute because they do not change based on the screen or text. Relative units work differently because their size depends on something else, such as the font size of the text or the size of the screen. For example, 2em means two times the current text size, so if the text is 16px, then 2em would equal 32px. Another example is 50vw which means the element will take up half the width of the screen no matter how big or small the screen is. Absolute units are useful when you need something to stay an exact size, while relative units are helpful for making websites flexible and easier to read on different devices.</p>
