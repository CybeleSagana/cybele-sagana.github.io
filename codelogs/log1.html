    <h2>What is the difference between non-semantic and semantic tags in HTML?</h2>
        <p>
                Non-semantic tags, such as < div > and < span >, are generic containers that do not provide any information about their content. 
                They are like plain boxes where you can put anything inside, but someone reading the code or a search engine looking at your page 
                would not know what the content represents. 
                For example, a < div > could contain a header, a paragraph, or a navigation menu, but its tag itself doesn not 
                communicate that meaning.  
                <br>
                <br>
                Semantic tags, on the other hand, have meaningful names that describe the purpose of the content inside. 
                Examples include < header >, < footer >, < article >, < section >, and < nav >.
                Using semantic tags tells browsers, developers, and search engines exactly what type of content is contained in that element. 
                For instance, a < header > clearly indicates introductory content, and an < article > indicates a self-contained piece of content. 
                This clarity improves accessibility, search engine optimization, and makes the code easier to understand and maintain.
        </p>
    <h2>What are two (or more) benefits of using semantic tags?</h2>
        <p>
            <h3> Benefits of Semantic HTML</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Better for search engines (SEO): Semantic tags, like < article > for blog posts or < nav > for menus, 
                    tell search engines what each part of your page means. 
                    This helps Google understand your content better, which can improve your website’s ranking..</li>
                <li>More accessible: Makes it easier for people using screen readers or other assistive tools.</li>
                <li>Easier to maintain: Semantic tags give your code a clear structure. 
                    It’s easier for you or other developers to read, update, and debug, 
                    making teamwork and long-term maintenance simpler.</li>
            </ol>
